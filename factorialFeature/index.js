// Factorial Feature
// In this project, you will use test-driven development to build a factorial method. You will use the assert module and mocha testing library to drive your development using tests that follow the phases: setup, exercise, and verification.

// How To Calculate Factorial

// You take an integer and you multiply that by all the integers that are less than it.

// The factorial of an integer n is denoted by an exclamation mark n!, so 5! is equal to:

//  5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
// Edge Case

// An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter — you can think of these as special cases that you need to account for. Based on the logic of factorials, you would expect that calculating 0! would look like this:

// 0 × 0 = 0
// But mathematically this is not true. In this instance of a factorial method, there is an edge-case which is that 0 factorial (or 0!) is 1.
